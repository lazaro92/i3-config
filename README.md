# i3-config
My configuration files.

The folders goes into the user's `.config` directory.

- I3 is the configuration of I3 itself (keybindings, colors, what bar uses...).
- I3status is the configuration of what is shown in the I3bar.
- I3lock contains a bash script that takes an screenshoot, blurs it and applies it into the I3lock background (uses `imagemagick` package software).
